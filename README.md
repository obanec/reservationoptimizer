Objective
The project aims to develop a web application designed to optimize the utilization of limited Zoom accounts within a company, allowing multiple users to schedule and manage meetings effectively without concurrency.

Scope
The web application will enable the reservation of meeting spots to prevent conflicts across shared Zoom accounts. Essential features will include:
Scheduling meetings to avoid account concurrency.
Requesting the next available meeting slot.
Managing account parameters such as email, type, and metadata.
User management for adding new users with credentials.
Role-based access control with standard host and admin privileges.
